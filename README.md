# fracto'ol
This project aims to create graphically fractals. First time in 2D programming and in the psychedelic universe of fractals in this project, using the miniLibX.

This is a basic computer graphics project. I am going to use my campus graphics library: the miniLibX. This library has been created in-house and includes basic tools needed to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events. This new project will be an opportunity to get familiar with miniLibX, to use the mathematical notion of complex numbers, to learn about the concept of optimisation in CGI and to practice handling events.
